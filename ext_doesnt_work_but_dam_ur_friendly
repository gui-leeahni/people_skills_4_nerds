the thing about js/node being ubiquitious means 
1) everyone has to use it at some point
2) signal/noise ratio of goodinfo/trashshitpost causes mental health issues
2b) YOU COULD DO A BETTER JOB NODE GOVERNMENT BY PERHAPS LAYING DOWN THE LAW (sometimes) 
2c) srsly lang-backed-by-all-megacorps, its a clown fiesta out there.

so, a color picker. im no front end. but seems an ez task? no?
perhaps its because its so ez that the top 2 ext in vscode are at 3 stars.
the builtin from ms only works under css conditions?
how about if i wanna change a color in my json settings file? hmmm?
neways, this is about social skills 4 nerds.

It seems that the installing failed.
Try to re-install the extension.
Remove C:\Users\xe6338.vscode\extensions\anseki.vscode-color-0.1.9 directory completely.
And install Color Picker again.

@mxdyyt1314
Do you mean that those are invalid command? Or did you execute those command?
Anyways, you should not execute those because those might break modules (dependencies) in your computer.

Displaying the message "Please wait a while for setting up the extension" is correct behavior.
You should wait for the finish when the message "Please wait" is displayed.

It seems that the installation failed.
And cache data in your computer might be broken.
You can clear the cache data by this:

Uninstall the extension.
Command to remove NPM cache data.
npm cache clean
Command to confirm the cache data were cleared.
npm cache ls
Remove Electron cache data in:
"%USERPROFILE%\.electron" (Windows)
~/.electron (others)
Re-install the extension.

From #77 . Environment is described in #77.
I followed #7 (comment)

Clean caches and open VSCode.
Open developer console of Electron.
Install color picker.
Run color picker, and console output lots of information like this:
screenshot_20181122_133832
...Then it automatically started to download something:
screenshot_20181122_133220

Finally, download finished
After downloading finished, I run color picker again and again, but it output some log without Color Picker shown. VSCode should be restarted.
screenshot_20181122_133807

Restart VSCode
Then restart VSCode, run color picker again, it works.

BTW, just curious that why not merely use a JS color picker, such as http://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/ ?

@kuanyui, thank you for the report.
So, do you mean that the Color Picker was not shown?
Or, was it shown? and was the issue solved?
